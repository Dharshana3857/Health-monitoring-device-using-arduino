# Arduino Health Monitoring Device

An Arduino-based health monitoring system that measures body temperature using an LM35 sensor and simulates heart rate (BPM) with a push button. The results are displayed on a 16√ó2 LCD, logged in the Serial Monitor, and an alert system (buzzer + LED) notifies when abnormal values are detected.
